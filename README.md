# Overview

I created a list maker program in TypeScript. It allows the user too create lists that can be populated
with items that the user can then check off. The user can also display these lists to the terminal.

I created this software to become more familiar with the TypeScript language and how to use it to
compile usable JavaScript code.

# Development Environment

I used the Visual Studio Code IDE.

I used the TypeScript language, and I used the prompt-sync library for user input.

# Future Work

- Make it so the lists can be saved and loaded to and from files.
- Create a function to clear completed items from a list.
- Make it so list items can be lists of sub items to complete.
